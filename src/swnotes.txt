Needs environment variable set TELHOME= "/usr/local/telescope" maybe get rid of references to TELHOME
writes to /var/log/syslog for errors etc
/usr/local/telescope/comm is where fifos could be

fifios are not getting open, don't think the open function is pointing to a valid name and location fixed
TODO:
change fifo location, things in /tmp get deleted on restart done
add read shm functions to tel.c done
get SHM to compile and link
need to flush fifo buffer, needs nonblocking read in python
